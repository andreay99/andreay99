## 🚀 Featured Hackathon Project

### 🧠 Offscript — AI-Powered Voice Interview Simulator
> Built at HackHarvard 2025  
> [Devpost Link](https://devpost.com/software/offscript)

**Description:**  
Offscript bridges the gap between technical knowledge and communication by simulating real coding interviews with AI-driven feedback. Users speak through problems while Offscript evaluates clarity, logic, and delivery — just like a real interviewer.

**Tech Stack:**  
Next.js • FastAPI • Gemini AI • Vapi • TailwindCSS • SQLite

**Key Features:**
- 🎤 Voice-based technical interviews with real-time feedback  
- 🧩 AI analysis of communication clarity and problem-solving flow  
- 📈 Performance analytics with transcript playback  
- ⚙️ Invisible metadata streaming for seamless code context tracking

**My Role:**  
Led backend AI orchestration, integrating Gemini AI to analyze user explanations and streamline code-context synchronization.
